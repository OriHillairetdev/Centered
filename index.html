<div class="testi-title">Testimonials</div>

<div class="testi-name"> SAVS (Southend voluntary services) Impact Statement Sept 2 2020,

Managing anxiety and relaxation:</div>

<div class="testi-content">"Our final session was all around EFT (emotional freedom tapping) by Deborah Hillairet. A technique that utilizes self  
awareness and evaluation, mixed with a set of 11 acupressure points and self affirmation. It allows parents or children  
to look at what might be causing a moment of stress or anxiety, and really focus on easing that single point in  
time. Lots of families attending mentioned kiddie chaos as a cause of current concern/stress. We went through the  
tapping sequence a few times concentrating on the issues at hand, then reaffirmed what we wanted to achieve by  
repeating the tapping sequence, this time instead of focusing upon the negative we focused upon becoming more  
balanced and able to deal with the situation and love ourselves. Parents said they noticed a difference in their stress  
levels after just a few rounds of repeating the tapping sequence, and one said they were going to sit with their older  
girls during the afternoon and see if it helped them to recognise their feelings, and find a way of processing them in a  
safe and calm environment"</div>

<div class="testi-name">Stacey:</div>

<div class="testi-content">"Dear Deborah From the bottom of my heart I cannot thank you enough for the help and support you have given me these past four weeks. I truly was at my lowest point and did not know where to turn. The tapping you carried out helped me deal with my issues no end,  but more so the kindness and understanding that radiates from you is a true gift. You really are one of life’s beautiful people. I have recommended you to my friends already. My words to anyone who is apprehensive regarding these types of treatments would be “go with an open mind and you will be blown away. Your life starts again here”"</div>

<div class="testi-name">Melody Old:</div>

<div class="testi-content">"I went to Deborah in August 2016 after suffering extreme grief and trauma in my life for the few years leading up.

She picked up on each chakra energy and was absolutely spot on and very precise on exactly what I was going through having never meet me before.

I felt a lot of emotions throughout the treatments but mainly and feeling of calm and peace.

Afterwards I felt much more balanced and managed to make a few big decisions that I hadn’t been able to make leading up to that time.

She is an amazing healer, I love her energy and presence – I would highly recommend Deborah for energy healing and yoga and a lovely person to have a chat with.

<div class="testi-name">Paula Mayura
Founder of Mayura Yoga Studio and Academy:</div>

<div class="testi-content">"I have known Deborah for more than 10 years, having met her firstly when she attended my Yoga classes. I believe Deborah’s spiritual journey was a driving force and underpinned her work as a therapist. She shortly afterwards left for South Africa to open her own retreat. A couple of years ago upon her return she offered her therapies at Mayura and also taught Kundalini Yoga for a short time. I have had treatments with Deborah, she works intuitively and with experienced sensitivity and has a wide variety of skills and therapies at her disposal with which to treat very individually""</div>
